# Social App Experiment (Abandoned)
After briefly attempting a dealership CMS (https://github.com/bencejdanko/carillo), we pivoted to another ambitious idea: a social media app with an Instagram-style UI. Built using React Expo and PocketBase, this project was an experiment in mobile development, authentication, and real-time data handling.

Developed during our time in the Zinnstarter program at San Jose State University (SJSU), this app was another stepping stone in our startup journey. While abandoned, it remains a snapshot of our learning processâ€”feel free to browse, cringe, or even build upon it!
